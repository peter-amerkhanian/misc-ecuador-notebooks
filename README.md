# Data exploration/visualization notebooks
This is a collection of some Jupyter notebooks containing various data exploration/analysis/visualization projects I conduct as part of my work.

Currently, I have uploaded two notebooks:

## Poverty Figures

An exploration of data on poverty rates in various large urban areas in Ecuador. This project makes use of the ongoing survey on poverty that the Ecuadorian government conducts twice a year. Data available here: http://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/pobreza-diciembre-2017/
